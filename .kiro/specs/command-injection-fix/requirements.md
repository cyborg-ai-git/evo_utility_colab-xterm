# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where custom commands cannot be passed to the xterm terminal in Jupyter Colab. Currently, when users try to use the magic command like `%xterm height=1000 port=10002 command="ls -l"`, the command parameter is not properly parsed and executed. The terminal starts with the default shell instead of running the specified command.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Jupyter Colab user, I want to pass custom commands to the xterm terminal using the magic command syntax, so that I can execute specific commands immediately when the terminal opens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a command parameter in the format `%xterm command="ls -l"` THEN the system SHALL execute the specified command in the terminal
2. WHEN a user provides multiple parameters like `%xterm height=1000 port=10002 command="ls -l"` THEN the system SHALL parse all parameters correctly and execute the command
3. WHEN a user provides a command with spaces or special characters THEN the system SHALL handle proper escaping and execute the command correctly
4. WHEN no command parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL default to the standard shell behavior as it currently does

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the command parameter parsing to be robust and secure, so that the system handles various command formats safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command contains quotes THEN the system SHALL properly parse and execute the command without breaking
2. WHEN a command contains shell metacharacters THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately without security vulnerabilities
3. WHEN an invalid command is provided THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN the command parameter is empty THEN the system SHALL default to normal shell behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing functionality to remain unchanged, so that current usage patterns continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `%xterm` without any parameters THEN the system SHALL behave exactly as it currently does
2. WHEN using existing parameters like `height` and `port` THEN the system SHALL continue to work as expected
3. WHEN combining the new command parameter with existing parameters THEN all parameters SHALL work together correctly
4. WHEN the command parameter is not provided THEN no existing functionality SHALL be affected
